GO ID	Term	Def
GO:0000001	mitochondrion inheritance	The distribution of mitochondria, including the mitochondrial genome, into daughter cells after mitosis or meiosis, mediated by interactions between mitochondria and the cytoskeleton.
GO:0000002	mitochondrial genome maintenance	The maintenance of the structure and integrity of the mitochondrial genome; includes replication and segregation of the mitochondrial chromosome.
GO:0000003	reproduction	The production of new individuals that contain some portion of genetic material inherited from one or more parent organisms.
GO:0000005	obsolete ribosomal chaperone activity	OBSOLETE. Assists in the correct assembly of ribosomes or ribosomal subunits in vivo, but is not a component of the assembled ribosome when performing its normal biological function.
GO:0000006	high-affinity zinc transmembrane transporter activity	Enables the transfer of zinc ions (Zn2+) from one side of a membrane to the other, probably powered by proton motive force. In high-affinity transport the transporter is able to bind the solute even if it is only present at very low concentrations.
GO:0000007	low-affinity zinc ion transmembrane transporter activity	Enables the transfer of a solute or solutes from one side of a membrane to the other according to the reaction: Zn2+ = Zn2+, probably powered by proton motive force. In low-affinity transport the transporter is able to bind the solute only if it is present at very high concentrations.
GO:0000008	obsolete thioredoxin	OBSOLETE. A small disulfide-containing redox protein that serves as a general protein disulfide oxidoreductase. Interacts with a broad range of proteins by a redox mechanism, based on the reversible oxidation of 2 cysteine thiol groups to a disulfide, accompanied by the transfer of 2 electrons and 2 protons. The net result is the covalent interconversion of a disulfide and a dithiol.
GO:0000009	alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase activity	Catalysis of the transfer of a mannose residue to an oligosaccharide, forming an alpha-(1->6) linkage.
GO:0000010	trans-hexaprenyltranstransferase activity	Catalysis of the reaction: all-trans-hexaprenyl diphosphate + isopentenyl diphosphate = all-trans-heptaprenyl diphosphate + diphosphate.
GO:0000011	vacuole inheritance	The distribution of vacuoles into daughter cells after mitosis or meiosis, mediated by interactions between vacuoles and the cytoskeleton.
GO:0000012	single strand break repair	The repair of single strand breaks in DNA. Repair of such breaks is mediated by the same enzyme systems as are used in base excision repair.
GO:0000014	single-stranded DNA endodeoxyribonuclease activity	Catalysis of the hydrolysis of ester linkages within a single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid molecule by creating internal breaks.
GO:0000015	phosphopyruvate hydratase complex	A multimeric enzyme complex, usually a dimer or an octamer, that catalyzes the conversion of 2-phospho-D-glycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate and water.
GO:0000016	lactase activity	Catalysis of the reaction: lactose + H2O = D-glucose + D-galactose.
GO:0000017	alpha-glucoside transport	The directed movement of alpha-glucosides into, out of or within a cell, or between cells, by means of some agent such as a transporter or pore. Alpha-glucosides are glycosides in which the sugar group is a glucose residue, and the anomeric carbon of the bond is in an alpha configuration.
GO:0000018	regulation of DNA recombination	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of DNA recombination, a DNA metabolic process in which a new genotype is formed by reassortment of genes resulting in gene combinations different from those that were present in the parents.
GO:0000019	regulation of mitotic recombination	Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of DNA recombination during mitosis.
GO:0000020	obsolete negative regulation of recombination within rDNA repeats	OBSOLETE. Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of genetic recombination within the DNA of the genes coding for ribosomal RNA.
GO:0000022	mitotic spindle elongation	The cell cycle process in which the distance is lengthened between poles of the mitotic spindle. Mitotic spindle elongation begins during mitotic prophase and ends during mitotic anaphase B.
GO:0000023	maltose metabolic process	The chemical reactions and pathways involving the disaccharide maltose (4-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucopyranose), an intermediate in the catabolism of glycogen and starch.
